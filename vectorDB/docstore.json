Check the scene for danger\nLook for anything that might be dangerous, like signs of fire, falling debris,\nor violent people. If your safety is at risk, remove yourself from the area\nand call for help.\nIf the scene is safe, assess the condition of the sick or injured person.\nDon\u2019t move them unless you must do so to protect them from danger.\n2. Call for medical help, if needed\nIf you suspect the sick or injured person needs emergency medical care,\ntell a nearby person to call 911 or the local number for emergency medical\nservices. If you\u2019re alone, make the call yourself.\n3. Provide care\nIf you can do so safely, remain with the sick or injured person until\nprofessional help arrives. Cover them with a warm blanket, comfort them,\nand try to keep them calm. If you have basic first aid skills, try to treat any\npotentially life-threatening injuries they have.\nRemove yourself from danger if at any point in the situation you think your\nsafety might be at risk.\nIn many cases, you can use an adhesive bandage to cover minor cuts,\nscrapes, or burns. To cover and protect larger wounds, you might need to\napply a clean gauze pad or roller bandage.\nTo apply a roller bandage to a wound, follow these steps:\n1. Hold the injured area steady.\n2. Gently but firmly wrap the bandage around the injured limb or body\npart, covering the wound.\n3. Fasten the bandage with sticky tape or safety pins.\n4. The bandage should be wrapped firmly enough to stay put, but not\nso tightly that it cuts off blood flow.\nTo check the circulation in a bandaged limb, pinch one of the person\u2019s\nfingernails or toenails until the color drains from the nail. If color doesn\u2019t\nreturn within two seconds of letting go, the bandage is too tight and\nneeds to be adjusted.3 steps for emergency situations\nFirst aid bandage7/21/24, 11:15 PM How to Make A Splint: Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-make-a-splint#applying-a-splint 2/14", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2061, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bb9eb87-082e-4492-8660-3acac3e04f4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bb9eb87-082e-4492-8660-3acac3e04f4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_path": "F:\\MedBot\\data\\How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 508024, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a9155f5-8937-47ad-abb3-165978cebbf7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_path": "F:\\MedBot\\data\\How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 508024, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-21"}, "hash": "e292383e072eb45b728d550590a2b284df69ea3ef736f44cb6c847d1959ea1a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If you suspect that someone has a third-degree burn, call 911.

It can also be used\nif you have a severe strain or sprain in one of your limbs.\nPlaced properly, a rigid splint will help ease the pain of an injury by\nmaking sure that the wounded area doesn\u2019t move.\nIf you or a loved one is injured at home or during an activity, such as\nhiking, you can create a temporary splint from materials around you.Materials you\u2019ll need Applying a splintHand splints\nWhen to see a doctorTakeaway\nWhat\u2019s a splint?\nADVERTISEMENTShare this article\n\ue902v\ue907\ue9017/21/24, 11:15 PM How to Make A Splint: Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-make-a-splint#applying-a-splint 7/14", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1768, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83713f5a-4f05-4b0b-b404-52b2fb9e9677": {"__data__": {"id_": "83713f5a-4f05-4b0b-b404-52b2fb9e9677", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_path": "F:\\MedBot\\data\\How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 508024, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d08ccfb1-fbd7-49a1-85da-4584dc528e1e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_path": "F:\\MedBot\\data\\How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 508024, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-21"}, "hash": "97f4ee37d424ed443a103e6177ad043f83d08e0c0863fa6ec2ba317139b8a484", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The first thing you\u2019ll need when making a splint is something rigid to\nstabilize the fracture. Items you can use include:\na rolled-up newspaper\na heavy stick\na board or plank\na rolled-up towel\nIf you\u2019re using something with sharp edges or something that might cause\nsplinters, such as a stick or board, be sure to pad it well by wrapping it in\ncloth. Proper padding can also help reduce additional pressure on the\ninjury.\nYou\u2019ll also need something to fasten the homemade splint in place.\nShoelaces, belts, ropes, and strips of cloth will work. Medical tape can\nalso be used if you have it.\nTry not to place commercial tape, such as duct tape, directly against a\nperson\u2019s skin.\nYou can follow the instructions below to learn how to apply a splint.\n1. Attend to any bleeding\nAttend to bleeding, if any, before you attempt to place the splint. You can\nstop the bleeding by putting pressure directly on the wound.\n2. Apply padding\nThen, apply a bandage, a square of gauze, or a piece of cloth.\nDon\u2019t try to move the body part that needs to be splinted. By trying to\nrealign a misshapen body part or broken bone, you may accidentally\ncause more damage.\n3. Place the splint\nCarefully place the homemade splint so that it rests on the joint above the\ninjury and the joint below it.\nFor example, if you\u2019re splinting a forearm, place the rigid support item\nunder the forearm. Then, tie or tape it to the arm just below the wrist and\nabove the elbow.\nAvoid placing ties directly over the injured area. You should fasten the\nsplint tightly enough to hold the body part still, but not so tightly that the\nties will cut off the person\u2019s circulation.What you\u2019ll need for splinting an injury\nHow to apply a splint7/21/24, 11:15 PM How to Make A Splint: Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-make-a-splint#applying-a-splint 8/14", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1862, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9967f318-4502-464e-9101-00c7d21805d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9967f318-4502-464e-9101-00c7d21805d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_path": "F:\\MedBot\\data\\How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 508024, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd53c7ee-26f6-4265-82ab-f4ebd3b2fdf8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_path": "F:\\MedBot\\data\\How to Make A Splint_ Materials You\u2019ll Need, Hand Splints, and More.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 508024, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-21"}, "hash": "62274bfd00eaf95abe21c02cfcd936c05ac59434e03720c898b18351f83b7535", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4.
